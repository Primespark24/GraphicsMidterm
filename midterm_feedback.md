## Notes:

* Four distinct parts:
    * `-1 Nope, I don't see any distinction of the steps `
  * Part 1 - Skycube Set Up - 15 pts
    * skycube of your own design with a sample object
      * Keep user's perspective in the center of the skycube
      * `-1 This is a little complicated, but it looks like you just downloaded the skycube textures`
      * Allow user to move and look around
      * `Good work on the citations`
      * proof posted April 9th (by midnight)
        * `late, but great`
  * Part 2 - Collision Set Up - 20 pts
    * Create a cube, show camera can't move through it
    * `-1 I am not going to let that break; at line 650 slide. Write better code`
    * `I am a little confused by your worldOrigin element of object.`
      * proof posted April 9th (by midnight)
      * * `late, but great`
  * Part 3 - World / Maze Creation - 40 pts
    * randomly generate a maze to move through (time or seed)
      * `Nice work integrating this code`
  * Part 4 - Complete Program and Final Demo - 15 pts
    * utilize texture mapping
    * object loading 
    * one meaningful feature not identified in README
      * `-4 I don't know if I see this. I know you have a no-clip mode, but that is not all that interesting`
    * posted by April 16th (by midnight)
      * `Yep! Looks great!`
  * Part 5 - Documentation - 10 pts
    * Program Document
      * collection of development screenshots with element descriptions
      * flowchart of maze generation and program interaction
        * `-1 This is pretty light.`
      * manual of features
      * build instructions
      * Code functionalization and documentation
        * `Documentation is good, functionalization is passable`
    * Project Reflection
      * Graded individually
    

General notes:

Overall I think this is a pretty slick piece of code. I am impressed with the overall look, I am impressed with the integration of the maze code. There are some things up above that seemed to be passed over.
